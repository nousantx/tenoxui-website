# `use` Function

`use` is a function that will store your tenoxui configuration. Currently, there's only two config property you can set, `property` and `breakpoints`

## Initializing Property

Before you use tenoxui, you need to add types and properties for tenoxui to execute. You can use `use` function `when` you needed more customization and also can access to `makeStyle` and `makeStyles` function.

If you only need the `tenoxui` function or use styles from classnames only like :

```html
<div class="bg-red p-2rem my-1rem br-6px">...</div>
```

You can add the property directly in `tenoxui` function, like this :

```js
tenoxui({
  bg: "background",
  p: "padding",
  my: ["marginTop", "marginBottom"]
});
```

And, if you want to use more complexity, you can use `use` function, like this :

```js
use({
  property: [{
    bg: "background",
    p: "padding",
    my: ["marginTop", "marginBottom"]
  }]
});

makeStyles({
  body: "bg-red p-2rem h-mn-100vh",
  // more selector
});

tenoxui(); // initialize tenoxui
```

We defined `bg-red` inside `makeStyles` function, but we can pass new styles inside of the element, like this :

```html
<body class="bg-blue">
  <main class="m-1rem p-10px">...</main>
</body>
```

What's the different between this :

```js
tenoxui({
  bg: "background",
  p: "padding",
  my: ["marginTop", "marginBottom"]
});

makeStyles({
  body: "bg-red p-2rem h-mn-100vh",
  // more selector
});
```

By using this approach, you can't change the styles from `makeStyles` function due to how JavaScript work, it's execute the first function. (it's basic).
