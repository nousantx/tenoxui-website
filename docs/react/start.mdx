# Get Started

Let's start using TenoxUI on your React project!

## Installation

Add tenoxui to your project :

```sh
npm i tenoxui --save-dev
```

Now, import tenoxui function on your `App.jsx` or `App.tsx` :

```jsx
import tenoxui from "tenoxui";
```

## First Class

Now, let's make an initial code before we use tenoxui classes. First, we need to import `useLayoutEffect` hooks, because tenoxui handle the styling process using DOM after the html is ready. ( You can use `useEffect`, but its loaded much slower than `useLayoutEffect`. Please, choose wisely for your need! )

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { useLayoutEffect } from "react";
```
And after that, you need to wrap tenoxui inside the hook :

```jsx
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  tenoxui();
}, []);
```

Now, let's make a little change to your `App.jsx` file, and it must looks like this :

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { useLayoutEffect } from "react";
import tenoxui from "tenoxui";

const App = () => {
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    tenoxui();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="box-100px bg-black p-2rem br-0.125rem">
      <h1 className="tc-hotpink">Hello</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Code above will generate a box with `black` background and `hotpink` for the text color.
