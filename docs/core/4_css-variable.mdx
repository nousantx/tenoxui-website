# CSS Variable

CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can create variables with local or global scope, change the variables with JavaScript, and change the variables based on media queries. - [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp)

## Working with CSS Variable

In tenoxui, there's several ways to deal with `CSS variable`. Here's the examples :

### 1. CSS File and Element Class Name

In this exampls, you need to add some variables inside of CSS file. Example :

```css title="index.css"
:root {
  --primary: #ccf654;
  --red-400: #f65454;
}
```

Now, you can access the value inside of element classname using `$`, like this :

```html title="index.html"
<h1 class="tc-$primary">Hello World!</h1>
```

Note: `tc` is type for `color` property!


### 2. Custom CSS Variable Class Name

You can also add custom variable directly inside your element class name, like this :

```html title="index.html"
<h1 class="[--primary]-blue tc-$primary">Hello World!</h1>
```

Instead of using CSS variables from CSS file, it will add `--primary` variable to the element.

### 3. Custom Type and Property

You can also add custom for the type and property. Instead of adding CSS property, you can add CSS variables instead. Example :

```js
use({ property: [{
  tc: "color",
  "my-color": "--my-color",
}]});
```

then, you can use it like this :

```html title="index.html"
<h1 class="my-color-blue tc-$my-color">Hello World!</h1>
```
