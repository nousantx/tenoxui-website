# Responsive Design

TenoxUI support responsive design by adding the breakpoints prefix to the elements.

## Default Breakpoints
- sm: `640px`
- md: `768px`
- lg: `1024px`
- xl: `1280px`

## Usage

Adding breakpoint prefix to the element :

```html
<div class="max-md:bg-red md:bg-blue lg:bg-green"></div>
```

## Important
If you want to use responsive design using tenoxui, you must define your classes like this :
```html
<div class="bg-red max-md:bg-red md:bg-blue lg:bg-green"></div>
```

Breakdown :

- `bg-red`: initial style.
- `max-md:bg-red`: fallback for smaller than md.
- `md:bg-blue`: blue background on medium screen.

You need to know :

Since tenoxui using JavaScript for handling all of the styles, the responsive design is also handled by JavaScript. If you want to add the responsive breakpoint to your element, you `must` avoid this kind of class names :

```html
<div class="bg-red md:bg-blue"></div>
```

It didn't know the styles that need to add below the medium screen. So, if you use that, the background will `stay` blue when your screen get smaller. Instead, use this :

```html
<div class="bg-red max-md:bg-red md:bg-blue"></div>
```

Other tips, always add the breakpoint for smaller screen than tye breakpoint you use :

If the breakpoint started with `md` add `max-md:` with the same classname as initial style, in this case is `bg-red` :
```html
<div class="bg-red max-md:bg-red md:bg-blue"></div>
```
It's same for other breakpoints, if you use `lg` for example :
```html
<div class="bg-red max-lg:bg-red lg:bg-blue"></div>
```

We're sorry if it makes your class name more larger, but this is only handled full by JavaScript.



## Customizing Breakpoints

You can use `use` function to customize your breakpoints. Example :

```js
use({
  property: [...],
  breakpoint: [
    { name: "xxl", min: 1440 },
    { name: "xs", min: 0, max: 554 },
  ]
});
```
