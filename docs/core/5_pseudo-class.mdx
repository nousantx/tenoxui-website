# Pseudo Class

In tenoxui, there's only two supported pseudo class (currently). This is `hover:` and `focus:`.

## Hover Effect

You can use `hover` effect by adding `hover:` prefix before the class name, like this :

```html
<div class="... bg-red hover:bg-blue"></div>
```

## Focus Effect

You can add `focus` effect by adding `focus:` prefix before the class name, like this :

```html
<button class="... bg-red focus:bg-blue"></button>
```
