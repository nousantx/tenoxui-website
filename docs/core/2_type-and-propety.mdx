# Type and Property

Types and propeties is class name settings for tenoxui, it's just bunch of classname prefix and declared property for its prefix. Example :

```js
{
  // type: property
  m: "margin",
  fs: "fontSize"
}
```

## Type

`Type` is the prefix that will triggered its property, this is also can be called as a shorthand that will trigger the property. In the example above, the `m` and `fs` is what we called type.

## Property

`Property` is what css property will given to the `type` we declared. From the example above, the `margin` and `fontSize` is called property. So basically, `property` is CSS property where the `type` should give the values. 

```js title="Default types and properties"
{ 
  p: "padding",
  tc: "color",
  "my-type": "backgroundColor" 
}
```

`Property` is not always a `CSS property`, you can also define `CSS variable` using it, and instead of set value for the CSS property, it will set values for the defined property.

## All Propeties

This is what property you can add or use :

### 1. Single CSS Property

This is simple type with `single` CSS property :

```js
{ 
  m: "margin",
  over: "overflow",
  ratio: "aspectRatio",
}
```

:::tip

You can also define property using `kebab-type`, like this :

```js
{ 
  ai: "align-items",
  "w-mx": "max-width"
}
```
:::


### 2. Multiple Properties

You can also use an array with multiple `CSS propeties` inside of it. Here's some examples :

```js
{ 
  mx: ["marginLeft", "marginRight"],
  box: ["width", "height"],
  "flex-parent": ["alignItems", "justifyContent"],
}
```

As you can see, we define the `property` as array, and it will set values for both properties. Example :

We define `mx` type for setting `margin-right` and `margin-left` propeties, so if you use it to your element like this :

```html
<div class="mx-2rem"></div>
```

And it will rendered as :

```html
<div class="mx-2rem" style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem;"></div>
```

So, it will set `2rem` for both properties.

### 3. CSS Variable as Property

You can also define `CSS variable` as the property, like this :

```js 
{
  size: "--size",
  "custom-color": "--my-color",
  "var-bg": "--back",
}
```

Now, how can i use it? See [CSS Variable](/docs/core/css-variable).

### 4. Prefixes

Maybe you wanna add prefixes, you can add just like regular property :

```js 
{
  "web-tr": "-webkit-transition",
  "moz-br": "mozBorderRadius",
}
```

:::info
The examples above can be used direclty inside `use` function, like this :

```js
use({ 
  property: [{
    m: "margin",
    mx: ["marginLeft", "marginRight"],
  }] 
});
```

Also, if you don't wanna add your types and properties one by one, we have a library that contain all types you may need, see [@tenoxui/property on GitHub](https://github.com/tenoxui/property).
