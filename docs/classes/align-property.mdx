# Align Property ðŸš€

Learn how to use align property for flexbox and grid layout

## Type Rules

There's some type you can use for align the items:

- `ai-` : Set `align-items` property

- `ac-` : Set `align-content` property

- `as-` : Set `align-self` property

## Simple Usage

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="html" label="index.html">
Add some html code, also 2-words value is not supported, so we will use value from css variables.
```html title="html"
<div class="jc-center ai-[flex-start]"></div>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="css" label="style.css">
Add some value that will be used in html.
```css title="css"
:root {
  --flex-start: flex-start;
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Two word value]

Keep in mind if you wan't to use 2-words value like `flex-start`, `space-between`, and others. Because, it's not supported value like that. But, you can see the alternative way, see [2-words value](/docs/extras/all-value#1-two-word-value).
